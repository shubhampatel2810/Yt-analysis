pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install pandas
pip install googleapiclient
Obtain your YouTube API key from the YouTube Developer Console.

makefile
Copy code
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts provided to perform data extraction and analysis.

Usage
To use this project, you can modify the code to analyze specific channels or videos of interest. Detailed usage instructions and code examples can be found in the project's Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts.

Data Analysis
In the data analysis phase, we perform tasks such as:

Collecting video metadata (title, views, likes, dislikes, comments, etc.).
Calculating engagement metrics (like-to-dislike ratio, comments-to-views ratio).
Identifying top-performing channels and videos.
Analyzing trends and patterns in the data.
